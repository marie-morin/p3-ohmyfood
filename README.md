# Oh my food Project - OpenClassRooms Web Developer
This project was brought as part of project 3 of the OpenClassRooms Web Developer training. 

En temps que d√©veloppeur web d'une start-up dans la restauration, je dois transformer une maquette en site internet fonctionnel.

As the web developer of a online restaurant reservation start-up, I am asked to translate a mockup into a functionnal web site.

The web site contains 6 pages  :

Home - 4 menu pages - legal notice

The project had to be code exclusivly in HTML and CSS, without the use of frameworks. Some CSS animaitons are requested. The page had to be fully responsive. The project was to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

The project uses:

HTML5 - CSS3 - SASS
